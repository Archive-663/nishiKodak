![nishiKodakforCanonEF](https://github.com/Archive-663/nishiKodak/blob/main/ASSETS/nishiKodak_fujiGFX.jpg)


### Features:
- Breech-lock  mounting ring
- 30mm focal length
- Fixed ~f11 aperture
- Four individual images on one frame

### Compatibility Note:
Tested on Fuji GFX50s. Print the '_depthChecker.stl' to check for any intereference between the baffles and the shutter. To verify, with no lens mounted, fire the shutter. Make a note of where the mechanical shutter fires from. Mount the depth checker and visually inspect to verify the rear baffle doesn't interfere with the mechanical shutter. If you feel confident it doesn't fire the shutter to confirm. I recommend using the electronic shutter only to avoid any potential interfernce if you're not comfortable with firing the mechanical shutter. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX9ajfPWNos" target="blank">How to use the Depth Checker</a>

### What you'll need:
- Lots of M1.6 x 5mm pan head screws (PETG or ABS filament)
  
  or

- Lots of M1.6 x 5mm self tapping screws (ABS filament)
- 1x M1.6 tap 
- 4x Kodak Funsaver lenses (post-2015 expiration date. Kodak had a few lens changes in the Funsaver production lifetime. You'll need a recent Funsaver to make this work)

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit
- M1.8/M2 drill bit

### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL.

Please view the printOrientation.3mf file for help with orienting the parts on the printer bed. 

### Assembly help:
I suggest drilling holds to their correct tap size before tapping. The M1.6 holes should be drilled out to 1.4mm then tapped with the M1.6 tap.

When assembling the rotating assemblies use some synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the rotate function smoother.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, <a href="https://www.freecad.org/downloads.php" target="_blank">download FreeCAD</a> to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble.
