### Printing help:
I print with PETG because it's pretty easy to set up with and dial in. If you want to use something else, go for it. I'd stay away from PLA because it's not the best in heat and against solvents. 

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. 

### Assembly help:
I suggest drilling holds to their correct tap size before tapping. The m1.6 holes should be drilled out to 1.4 then tapped with the m1.6 tap. The Rotator holes should be drilled out with an m2 or m1.8 drill bit.

When assembling the rotating assemblies use some synthetic grease similar to Super Lube PTFE or keycap lube to make the rotate function smoother.
